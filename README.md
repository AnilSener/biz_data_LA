# Section 2. Predicting popularity of Yelp Business using Spark Machine Learning, 2017

To predict the popularity of the business we defined the popular business to have stars greater than 3 and unpopular business to have stars less than 3. To select the feature columns and have the accurate prediction for the popularity of the business we chose the food category. All the attribute columns related to the food category like good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, take out, delivery, parking, alcohol, Wi-Fi, waiter service, wheelchair and noise level are considered as feature columns. We categorize all the columns for the classification models like Two Class Logistic regression and Two Class Boosted Decision Tree.

The logistic regression is used to find the probability of the two states of the target variable. Whereas the boosted decision tree is an ensemble learning tree to make the prediction. Both the models are suitable for the prediction of the popularity of the business. The logistic regression is considered to be the best in fast training and linear classification model whereas boosted decision tree is known for its accuracy, fast training and large memory footprint, apt for big data.

The detail implementation of two class logistic regression in Spark ML using Train Validation Split and Binary Classification Evaluator in Spark can be followed in Classification-Food.md . The regularization para meters used to avoid the imbalances in data are 0.01, 0.5 and 2.0. The PramGridBuilder is used to generate all possible combinations of regularization parameter, max iterator and threshold. The AUR value of model is low due to training the logistic regression for the complete dataset as oppose to the sampled dataset. The dataset had a very small percentage of food business having less than 3 stars. Thus, the model is not trained well to predict unpopular business. The result could improve if the dataset was balanced with popular and unpopular business.
